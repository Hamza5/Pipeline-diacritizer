# Multi-components system for automatic Arabic diacritics restoration## AboutThis is a command-line application written in Python 3, made for research purposes to automatically add diacritics toraw undiacritized Arabic text. To accomplish this task, it uses several techniques: Deep Learning, rule-based andstatistical corrections. The deep learning part was implemented using Tensorflow.## FunctionalitiesThis software has 4 main functionalities: preprocessing of the data, training on the processed data, testing, andrestoring the diacritics of an undiacritized text.This is a quick introduction to the most important ones, without mentioning all the possible options for each one. Foradditional options, consider calling any subcommand with the option `--help` or `-h` (ex:`python3 pipeline_diacritizer.py train --help`).### PreprocessingBefore feeding the new data to this application for training or testing, it needs to be converted to the standard formatof this application: one sentence per line, where a sentence is delimited by a dot, a comma, or an end of linecharacter.```$ python3 pipeline_diacritizer.py process <source_file> <destination_file>```If the data is not yet partitioned into training, validation and testing sets, the program can help in this task usingthe following command:```$ python3 pipeline_diacritizer.py partition <dataset_file>```### TrainingTo run the training and validation on selected training/validation sets, use the next command:```$ python3 pipeline_diacritizer.py train --train-data <train_file> --val-data <val_file>```### TestingTo evaluate the performances of the application on a testing set, use this command:```$ python3 pipeline_diacritizer.py test <test_file>```### DiacritizationThe following command restores the diacritics of the Arabic words from the supplied text file and outputs a diacritizedcopy:```$ python3 pipeline_diacritizer.py diacritize <text_file>```
